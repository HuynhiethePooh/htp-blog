Zilte is located in the 8th floor of MAS Museum in central Antwerp. I booked a reservation there as a nice pre-game for myself before going to see Olivia Rodrigo. This was one of my favorite meals I've had so far - the service, atmoshpere and food is an amazing gateway into what makes a restaurant a 3 star.
