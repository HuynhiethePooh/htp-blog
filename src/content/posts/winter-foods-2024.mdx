Everyone in NY will give you a üòÆ if you tell them that you haven't been to classic food joints or newly hyped places. Since you have to go through this on average 2 times a week I have made it a goal to reduce that down as much as possible. Here are 10 popular restaurants I've visited (for generally the first time) recently and whether they lived up to the hype or not!

## Lysee 
I still haven't had the chance to get the "Corn" at Lysee, but I have tried the namesake cake, along with Very Important Chocolate and Apple-Yuja Tart! Every creation there looks beautiful and also gets the highest Asian dessert compliment - "Yummy and not too sweet üòç" I think this is still consistently the best dessert I've had in Manhattan and it definitely deserves the hype!

## Hamburger America 
There is constant discourse on what the best cheap burger in NYC is and I do *not* think it's seventh street, but that is for another day. The first time I had Hamburger America it was really salty and I was kind of disapointed tbh. Another day when I was walking by I saw that George Motz was actually behind the counter cooking and there was virtually no line! I ordered the onion burger again and this time the patty was so crispy and perfectly seasoned. It's a pretty hard burger to beat when it's $8 for a single patty. I am hoping that it's not only that good when George is in, but I am open to coming in another time to test that theory out!

## Los Tacos No.1
So my hot take is that Saint Paul actually has a really great Mexican food scene. I think that in the US it's pretty much a tier below the top Cali and Texas contenders. I also think NYC has a ton of Mexican choices but it's a bit overhyped. Los Tacos' Meat is really well seasoned and cooked though so I think the hype is well worth it! It does hurt a bit paying $5+ for a taco as that feels very against street tacos in my mind.
