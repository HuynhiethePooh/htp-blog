Everyone in NY will give you a 😮 if you tell them that you haven't been to classic food joints or newly hyped places. Since you have to go through this on average 2 times a week I have made it a goal to reduce that down as much as possible. Here are 10 popular restaurants I've visited (for generally the first time) in Q1 (yes I had to business speak this) and whether they lived up to the hype or not!

## Lysee 
### 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 10/10 Hyped 
I still haven't had the chance to get the "Corn" at Lysee, but I have tried the namesake cake, along with Very Important Chocolate and Apple-Yuja Tart! Every creation there looks beautiful and also gets the highest Asian dessert compliment - "Yummy and not too sweet 😍" This is still consistently the best dessert I've had in Manhattan and it definitely deserves the hype!

## Hamburger America
### 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬜️⬜️ 8/10 Hyped  
There is constant discourse on what the best cheap burger in NYC is and I do *not* think it's seventh street, but that is a battle for another day. The first time I had Hamburger America it was really salty and I was kind of disapointed tbh. It was also kind of soggy and the flavor of the onions came through a bit *too* much. About 2 weeks later I was walking by I saw that George Motz was actually behind the counter cooking and there was virtually no line! I ordered the onion burger again and this time the patty was so crispy and perfectly seasoned. It's a pretty hard burger to beat when it's $8 for a single patty. I am hoping that it's not only that good when George is in, but I am open to coming in another time to test that theory out!

## Los Tacos No.1
### 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬜️⬜️⬜️ 7/10 Hyped  
So my hot take is that Saint Paul actually has a really great Mexican food scene. I think that in the US it's pretty much a tier below the top Cali and Texas contenders. I also think NYC has a ton of Mexican choices but it's a bit overhyped as a lot of places have just pretty okay options. Los Tacos' Meat is really well seasoned and cooked though so I think the hype is well worth it! It does hurt a bit paying $5+ for a taco as that feels very against street tacos in my mind.

## L'industrie
### 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 10/10 Hyped  
This is my favorite slice of Pizza in NYC and I don't care that it's the most basic opinion at the moment. I've liked every single slice I've gotten here and the Burrata Slice and the Fig and Bacon Slice are some of the best flavor combos I've ever had on a pie. The line outside the West Village location is usually pretty good unless it's a warm weekend morning so my waits have usually been \<5 minutes! Anyone who knows my annoying eating habits also knows that I always leave the crust behind unless it's super thin or the perfect amount of chewy. I actually typically finish 75% of the crust here and that is probably the highest average of the typical NY slices that I go to.
