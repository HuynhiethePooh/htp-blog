At work I got the opportunity to enroll into a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)! I've been excited to find some organic vegetables that actually taste fresh because some days Trader Joes does **not** cut it. I am currently splitting my bags with 2 other coworkers and looking to make the most out of the variety I get!
