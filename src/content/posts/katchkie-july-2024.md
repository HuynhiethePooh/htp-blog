At work I got the opportunity to enroll into a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)! I've been excited to find some organic vegetables that actually taste fresh because some days Trader Joes does **not** cut it. I am currently splitting my bags with 2 other coworkers and looking to make the most out of the variety I get!

I really enjoyed getting a mix of vegetables and having to figure out how everything fits into my week!
I instantly saw the pumpkin, squash and zuchini and thought of a nice air fried mix for a meal. I use onions and 
basil a lot for pickling and topping so that was easy to recognize I need to store them in jars!


It was so satifying to see how fresh my veggies were, so the tomatoes and cucumbers didn't last very long. Whole foods just started carrying
Cava's green goddess sauce so I knew i wanted to indulge in some of that with Cucumber as a snack. Maybe for future drops I'll find more creative ways to use everything, but for now I am still excited to actually have veggies that look great and taste just as good!
