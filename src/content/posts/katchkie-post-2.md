After missing a week due to some European travels, I am back for another week of figuring out what to do with some veggies from Katchkie Farm up in Kinderhook! I was really excited to actually cook up some food after 2 weeks of traveling and actually using my tiny kitchen. 

Drop included: 
- 1 Big ass steak tomato
- 1 Dozen tiny adirondack red potatoes
- 1/2 Dozen root carrots
- Bunch of Leeks
- 2 Sweet Pepps
- 3 really nice sweet onions 

This was a bit of a smaller batch, but I knew exactly what I wanted to make. When I see potatoes, carrots and onions I instantly think of Japanese Curry (with a glizzy of course). The onions,peppers and tomatoes were nice to make a sweet pico for chips and to share with some friends and an easy way to get rid of those ingredients. The leeks had me a bit stumped, but then I remembered that there's this Molly Baz recipe for leek pasta that looks amazing and I think it's one of my fav Molly recipes I've ever made! The leeks paired with the lemon and creme cut the leek flavor perfectly while still letting it be the star of the dish.
